A test shell for [dyibicc](https://github.com/sgraham/dyibicc).

Hooked up to [raylib](https://raylib.com/) and [nvim](https://neovim.io) so far.

It's probably too much hassle to build yet, but if you want to try, you
should put dyibicc as a sibling, build dyibicc via `make.bat`, then
build `rdy` via its `make.bat`.
